## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Analyze survival rates based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age
  - Embarkation point
  - Family size
- Visualize patterns using bar plots, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps

## 📊 Key Insights

- Females had a significantly higher survival rate
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive
- Infants and children had better survival chances
- Embarked passengers from Cherbourg (C) had higher survival probability
